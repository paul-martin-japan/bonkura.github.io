        <h2> <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><i>Horace,

        <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><br>
          The snows are fled away, leaves on the shaws<br>
          And grasses in the mead renew their birth,<br>
          The river to the river-bed withdraws,<br>
          And altered is the fashion of the earth.<br>
          <br>
          The Nymphs and Graces three put off their fear<br>
          And unapparelled in the woodland play.<br>
          The swift hour and the brief prime of the year<br>
          Say to the soul, Thou wast not born for aye.<br>
          <br>
          Thaw follows frost; hard on the heel of spring<br>
          Treads summer sure to die, for hard on hers<br>
          Comes autumn with his apples scattering;<br>
          Then back to wintertide, when nothing stirs.<br>
          <br>
          But oh, whate'er the sky-led seasons mar,<br>
          Moon upon moon rebuilds it with her beams;<br>
          Come we where Tullus and where Ancus are<br>
          And good Aeneas, we are dust and dreams.<br>
          <br>
          Torquatus, if the gods in heaven shall add<br>
          The morrow to the day, what tongue has told?<br>
          Feast then thy heart, for what thy heart has had<br>
          The fingers of no heir will ever hold.<br>
          <br>
          When thou descendest once the shades among,<br>
          The stern assize and equal judgment o'er,<br>
          Not thy long lineage nor thy golden tongue,<br>
          No, nor thy righteousness, shall friend thee more.<br>
          <br>
          Night holds Hippolytus the pure of stain,<br>
          Diana steads him nothing, he must stay;<br>
          And Theseus leaves Pirithous in the chain<br>
          The love of comrades cannot take away. <br>
