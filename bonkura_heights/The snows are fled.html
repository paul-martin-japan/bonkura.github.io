    <p><span style="font-family: Courier;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were heavy
        snows in the February of 2014. The roads roads became temporarily
        impassable; neither was it easy to move around on foot. The snow made
        our lives miserable here in Fukushima for several days. And so it was
        that one sunny morning in March, when the snow had gone, I surprised
        myself as I found myself saying "Diffugere nives" without thinking and
        with a kind of glee.</span></p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier;"> </span>
    <p><span style="font-family: Courier;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime earlier I
        had come across an anecdote about A. E. Housman, who is said to have
        ended a lecture on Horace in May 1914 by asking his students to consider
        the ode in question (Book 4, Ode VII)&nbsp; "simply as poetry," and to
        make his point is said to have read them his own translation.
        Uncharacteristically, he is also described as having pointed out that
        this ode of Horace is "the most beautiful poem in ancient literature."
        The anecdote prompted me to look up the ode in question, which did not
        strike me as any more impressive than some of the other odes. It was not
        until I read Housman's translation of Ode VII that the scales fell from
        my eyes. The original and the translation, both tours de force, are
        extraordinary. It took the poet and teacher Housman to illuminate the
        craftsmanship of the Latin with his own.</span></p>
