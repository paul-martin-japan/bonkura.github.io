      snows are fled...</span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: Courier;">There were heavy snows in the February
      of 2014. The roads became temporarily impassable; neither was it easy to
      move around on foot. The snow made our lives miserable here in Fukushima
      for several days. And so it was that one sunny morning in March, when the
      snow had gone, I found myself saying "diffugere nives" almost
      unconsciously and with a kind of glee.<br>
      A few days earlier,&nbsp; I had come across an anecdote about the poet and
      classics scholar A. E. Housman in "A. E. Housman" (Richard Perceval
      Graves, faber and faber), which goes as follows:</span><br>
    <br>
    <em><span style="font-family: Courier;">One of his students, a woman, later
        recalled how:</span></em><br>
    <br>
    <em><span style="font-family: Courier;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At five minutes
        past 11 he used to walk to the desk, open his manuscript, and begin to
        read. At the end of the hour he folded his papers and left the room. He
        never looked either at us or at the row of dons in the front.</span></em><br>
    <br>
    <em><span style="font-family: Courier;">Only once was there a change from
        his routine:</span></em><br>
    <br>
    <em><span style="font-family: Courier;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning in
        May 1914, when the trees in Cambridge were covered with blossom, he
        reached in his lecture Ode 7 in Horace's Fourth Book, 'Diffugere Nives,
        redeunt iam gramina campis'. This ode he dissected with the usual
        display of brilliance, wit, and sarcasm. Then for the first time in two
        years he looked up at us, and in a quite different voice said: 'I should
        like to spend the last few minutes considering this ode simply as
        poetry.'Å@Our previous experience of Professor Housman would have made us
        sure that he would regard such a proceeding as beneath contempt. He read
        the ode aloud with deep emotion first in Latin, and then in an English
        translation of his own. </span></em><br>
    <em><span style="font-family: Courier;">'That', he said hurriedly, almost
        like a man betraying a secret, 'I regard as the most beautiful poem in
        ancient literature' and walked quickly out of the room.</span></em> <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: Courier;"><em>Afterwards another undergraduate, a
        scholar of Trinity, commented: 'I felt quite uncomfortable. I was afraid
        the old fellow was going to cry.'</em></span><br>
